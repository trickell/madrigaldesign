				John Madrigal &#8212; Who is this guy? Not only a professional web developer, but 
				he also likes to consider himself a creative and unique nutcase. Here is a little 
				more about him.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<div class="a_columns">				
				<p>
					He grew up in a small town called Glasgow, KY. After attempting to relocate to the moon and 
					afterwords considering "the issues" of life form there, he now lives in the college town
					Bowling Green, KY where he has attended Western Kentucky University. Someone might be
					thrown back by his unusual wide range of skills. Not only is John a mad Photoshop warrior,
					but he can destroy some technical bugs with his magical range in code and design. Not to
					mention, he also does what he calls, "Ninja Tutoring" &#8212; something that is quick and to the point.
				</p>
				<p>
					When John is not commenting code or playing around on some social network, he is battling it
					out with code and design trying to perfect the smallest details in anything. Along those lines,
					he will continually try to perfect anything he touches, be it a game, a design, or a web site.

				So truly, who is John Madrigal? He is a friend, a perfectionist, a developer, a designer, a
				person who believes in making dreams reality, and a very intellectual person. Should you hire
				him? Well, that is a desicion only you can make. Try basing it on an actual conversation though.
